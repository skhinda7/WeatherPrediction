## Introduction

Welcome to my CS 225 final project. This is a software (currently in development) that will take the previous 5+ days of data and using linear and polynomial regression, it will output a predicted model of data for the future days. The input is given by the user via input.csv and the software will create a file called prediction.txt so the user may save the results as needed. The results are only predicted using the mentioned algorithms. This leaves the prediction models to be used to predict other statistics unrelated to weather.

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
